This anonymous repository is conducted for rebuttal of the paper: ''Penalty-based Methods for Simple Bilevel Optimization under HÃ¶lderian Error Bounds'' (10087).

## linear regression problem
'linear_lower.jpg' and 'linear_upper.jpg' are the lower and upper gaps of the linear regression problem, respectively.

'linear_testerror.jpg' is the figure of the test error result.

## integral equation problem
'integral_lower.jpg' and 'integral_upper.jpg' are the lower and upper gaps of the integral equation problem, respectively.

## fair classification problem
'fair_lower.jpg' and 'fair_upper.jpg' are the lower and upper gaps of the fair classification problem, respectively.

'fair_accuracy.jpg' is the figure of the accuracy result.


## Main experiments
'logistic_lower.jpg' and 'logistic_upper.jpg' are the experimental results of the logistic regression problem (LRP) in Section 4.1 of our paper.

'least_lower.jpg' and 'least_upper.jpg' are the experimental results of the least squares regression problem (LSRP) in Section 4.2 of our paper.
